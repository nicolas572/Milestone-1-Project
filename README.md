## General Requirements

- This is a solo project! (Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together.)
- This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class.
- This game must run in a web browser.
- This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum of 10 commits.
- Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
- This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location.

## Game Requirements

- The game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or for 1 player (PvE).
  - The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI. (In this case, think of "AI" as a logical pattern.)
  - For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- The game should be winnable, or it should keep score (or track player progress in a meaningful way).
  - When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts.
  - If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be written in separate files.
- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance.
- The HTML code should use sematic tags.
- The GitHub repository for your game should have a README.md that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.

# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

--------

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://nicolas572.github.io/Milestone-1-Project/>.


## Project Description

A snake-style game, in the form of a dragon, a timeless favorite!


## Game Logic

```

-Start at top-left of screen
-Use of all arrow keys
-Eat dragonfruit
-Dragon grows longer
-Player wins once they've eaten 50 dragonfruits
-Player loses if they collide into themselves
-Player loses if they collide into wall


```

### MVP Criteria

- Dragon grows when eating food
- Game over when collisions happen
- Reset game button


### Post-MVP Plans

- SoundFx for when you eat food or lose game
- Make food an image instead of color
- Add background music
- Keep high score
